A) Categorizing 
B) Chunking
C) Mapping
D) Clustering 
Hint: "Think about how you remember a phone number or a long password. Instead of trying to recall every digit individually, what’s a trick you might use to make it easier? 

Q3: Why does our brain struggle with processing too much information at once?

B) It has a limited processing capacity.
C) It focuses on emotional over factual data.

B) Learning historical dates as part of a timeline. 
C) Memorizing a list of random, unrelated words. 
D) Breaking down a speech into key points.

Q5)What is a suggested method to manage memory limitations and information overload? 
A) Avoid all distractions. 
B) Chunk information into manageable pieces. 
C) Rely solely on long-term memory. 
D) Study continuously without breaks
